That's a RAK3172-based LR 14 click board. You can reprogram the RAK3172 module on it, which contains an STM32WLE5CCU6 chip.
Here are the steps you'll need to follow in STM32CubeIDE to create a project and prepare for uploading your code:

1. Create a New Project in STM32CubeIDE 💻
Select the Target MCU
When starting a new project, select the specific microcontroller used inside the RAK3172 module.
    Select File > New > STM32 Project.
    In the Target Selection window, go to the MCU/MPU Selector tab.
    Search for and select STM32WLE5CCU6. This is the LoRaWAN® System-on-Chip (SoC) inside the RAK3172 module.

2. Base Settings and Configuration (STM32CubeMX) ⚙️
After selecting the MCU, the STM32CubeMX configuration environment will open. Here, you'll set up the clock, peripherals, and debug settings.

    Clock Configuration
        Go to the Clock Configuration tab. You'll need to enable the High-Speed External (HSE) crystal oscillator for the main clock source and the Low-Speed External (LSE) for the Real-Time Clock (RTC), as recommended for LoRa applications. The RAK3172 module includes both the 32 MHz (HSE) and 32.768 kHz (LSE) crystals.

    Debug Settings
        Go to the Pinout & Configuration tab.
        Under System Core > SYS, set the Debug option to Serial Wire (SWD). This configures the necessary pins for ST-Link programming.

    LoRaWAN Peripherals (Optional but likely needed)
        If you're writing a LoRaWAN application, you will need to enable and configure the required peripherals, such as:
            RF (Radio Frequency) section: This is critical for LoRa.
            UART: For debugging or communicating with a host system (likely connected to the TX and RX pins on the LR 14 click board).
            SPI/I2C: If you are connecting external sensors to the other click pins (SCK, SDO, SDI, SDA).

    Pin Configuration
        The pins on the LR 14 click board map to specific pins on the STM32WLE5CCU6. You would need to refer to the RAK3172 datasheet/schematic to know which MCU pin corresponds to the board's headers (e.g., TX, RX, CS). You'll set these pin functions here.
