LORAWAN - general discuss
- how it works
- what kind of lorawan classes (A/B) exist
- how to create connect to gateway from my code
- C/H stm32Cubeide

next:
include in my code everything, what is necessary for establish of connection to Server - create code
- I want to only check - the connection is establish and if yes, I want to send to server my buffer
- maybe I will need to switch from class A to B - also create for me function to process it
- I will need to download from server the data, not only send, e.g. new firmware - can be class A or it must be done via classB?

so, I don't spend my time with investigate how lorawan works. Therefor I need code, which takes everything about lorawan. I need code for:
- init of lorawan
- optional, set LORAWAN_APP_KEY or leave set from Server
- LORAWAN_DEVICE_EUI, LORAWAN_DEVICE_ADDRESS - define from MCU
- in main - call for lorawan process
- check the connection and if is established, I want to send my buffer
can you create/modify the files from my repository Senzors for my scenario?

In my repository exists LoRaWAN/App and LoRaWAN/Target
For generate code for me, take these files and modify them by my requests
